## Calculations

The application performs the following calculations:

1. **Distance**: Haversine formula for great circle distance on Earth's surface
   - Formula: `d = 2R × arcsin(√(sin²(Δφ/2) + cos(φ1)×cos(φ2)×sin²(Δλ/2)))`
   - R = Earth radius (6371 km), φ = latitude, λ = longitude

2. **Path Sampling**: 50 interpolated points along the great circle path
   - Used for both elevation profile and curved line visualization on map

3. **Elevation Lookup**: Batch query to Open-Elevation API for all sample points

4. **Line of Sight**: Linear interpolation from start to end point (including antenna heights)

5. **Earth's Curvature**: Applies 4/3 Earth radius correction (8,494.67 km effective radius)
   - Formula: `curvature_offset = (d1 × d2) / (2 × R)`
   - Accounts for atmospheric refraction in RF propagation
   - Critical for paths over ~5km where curvature becomes significant
   - Visualized on map with curved polylines

6. **Obstruction Check**: Compares terrain elevation vs. curved LOS line at each sample point

7. **Antenna Bearing (Azimuth)**:
   - Formula: `θ = atan2(sin(Δλ)×cos(φ2), cos(φ1)×sin(φ2) - sin(φ1)×cos(φ2)×cos(Δλ))`
   - Converts to 0-360° range and cardinal directions (N, NE, E, etc.)
   - Calculated bidirectionally for both endpoints

8. **Elevation Angle (Vertical)**:
   - Formula: `angle = atan2(Δh, d) × 180/π`
   - Δh = height difference (including antenna heights)
   - d = horizontal distance in meters
   - Positive angle = point antenna up, negative = point down

9. **Free Space Path Loss (FSPL)**:
   - Formula: `FSPL(dB) = 20×log₁₀(d_km) + 20×log₁₀(f_MHz) + 32.45`
   - Calculates signal attenuation in free space
   - Used for link budget planning

10. **First Fresnel Zone**:
    - Formula: `radius = √((λ × d1 × d2) / (d1 + d2))`
    - Where λ = wavelength, d1 = distance to point, d2 = distance from point
    - Calculates clearance zone needed for optimal RF propagation
    - Clearance percentage = (actual clearance / radius) × 100%
    - Status thresholds: ≥100% Excellent, ≥60% Good, ≥20% Marginal, ≥0% Poor, <0% Obstructed
    - 60% clearance (0.6 × radius) recommended for reliable communications

11. **Knife-Edge Diffraction** (ITU-R P.526):
    - **Fresnel-Kirchhoff parameter**: `v = h × √(2(d1 + d2) / (λ × d1 × d2))`
      - h = obstacle height above LOS line (m)
      - d1, d2 = distances from transmitter/receiver to obstacle (m)
      - λ = wavelength (m)
    - **Diffraction Loss**: `L(v) = 6.9 + 20×log₁₀(√((v - 0.1)² + 1) + v - 0.1)` dB
    - **Multi-obstacle**: Uses primary obstacle loss + weighted secondary obstacles
    - Detects obstacles within 5m below LOS line for near-grazing cases

12. **K-Factor (Atmospheric Refraction)**:
    - Effective Earth radius: `R_eff = k × R_earth`
    - Standard atmosphere: k = 4/3 (1.333)
    - Subrefractive: k < 1.2 (signal bends away from Earth)
    - Superrefractive: k > 1.35 (enhanced propagation)
    - Ducting: k > 1.6 (extreme range extension)
    - Affects LOS horizon and path clearance calculations

13. **Link Budget (ERP Calculator)**:
    - **ERP (Effective Radiated Power)**: `ERP = P_tx + G_ant - L_cable` (dBm)
    - **Received Power**: `P_rx = ERP - FSPL + G_rx - L_cable_rx` (dBm)
    - **Link Margin**: `Margin = P_rx - Sensitivity` (dB)
    - **Fade Margin**: `Fade = Margin - SNR_required` (dB)
    - **Power Conversions**:
      - dBm to Watts: `P(W) = 10^(P(dBm)/10) / 1000`
      - dBd to dBi: `G(dBi) = G(dBd) + 2.15`
    - Quality thresholds: Excellent ≥20dB, Good ≥10dB, Marginal ≥0dB, Poor ≥-6dB

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)

## Known Limitations

- Elevation data accuracy depends on Open-Elevation API resolution (~30m in most areas)
- Path assumes great circle route (not actual terrain-following RF propagation)
- Frequency range limited to 30-3000 MHz (VHF/UHF bands)
- Clutter losses (buildings, vegetation) not included in calculations
- Diffraction calculations use ITU-R P.526 knife-edge approximation (actual terrain may differ)
- K-factor modeling is simplified (real atmospheric conditions vary continuously)
