   - Name your points for easy identification (e.g., "Tower 1", "Building A")

2. **Configure Each Point**:
   - Enter antenna/tower heights in meters for each point independently

   - Adjust coordinates precisely using the input fields

3. **Select Frequency Band**:
   - Choose between 2m (144 MHz) or 70cm (432 MHz) in the RF Analysis section
   - Frequency affects Fresnel zone size and path loss calculations

4. **Select a Path**:
   - Click any blue line on the map, OR
   - Click any distance label (e.g., "5.23 km")
   - The selected line, markers, and labels turn red
   - LOS and RF analysis starts automatically

5. **Review Results**:
   - Check the status (CLEAR or BLOCKED)
   - View the elevation profile chart with Earth's curvature and Fresnel zone
   - See Free Space Path Loss and Fresnel zone radius
   - Hover over the chart to see precise locations on the map
   - Click ‚¨Ü to expand the chart for detailed analysis
   - Distance displays dynamically on the chart x-axis

6. **Interactive Chart Analysis**:
   - Hover over elevation points to see exact locations marked on the map
   - Observe Fresnel zone (blue shaded area) clearance
   - Move mouse outside chart area to hide the location marker

7. **Analyze Multiple Paths**:
   - Click different lines to analyze various combinations
   - Distance labels show for all point pairs
   - Each analysis updates the chart and RF metrics
   - Compare 2m vs 70cm by toggling frequency

8. **Manage Points**:
   - Remove points using the √ó button (minimum 2 required)
   - Drag markers to adjust positions (calculations auto-update)
   - Add/remove points as needed for your network planning
   - Use üéØ button to reset map zoom to fit all points

## API Usage

This application uses the free [Open-Elevation API](https://open-elevation.com/) for terrain elevation data. No API key required.

## Calculations

The application performs the following calculations:

1. **Distance**: Haversine formula for great circle distance on Earth's surface
2. **Path Sampling**: 50 interpolated points along the great circle path
3. **Elevation Lookup**: Batch query to Open-Elevation API for all sample points
4. **Line of Sight**: Linear interpolation from start to end point (including antenna heights)
5. **Earth's Curvature**: Applies 4/3 Earth radius correction (8,494.67 km effective radius)
   - Formula: `curvature_offset = (d1 √ó d2) / (2 √ó R)`
   - Accounts for atmospheric refraction in RF propagation
   - Critical for paths over ~5km where curvature becomes significant
6. **Obstruction Check**: Compares terrain elevation vs. curved LOS line at each sample point
7. **Free Space Path Loss (FSPL)**:
   - Formula: `FSPL(dB) = 20√ólog‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(d_km) + 20√ólog‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(f_MHz) + 32.45`
   - Calculates signal attenuation in free space
   - Used for link budget planning
8. **First Fresnel Zone**:
   - Formula: `radius = ‚àö((Œª √ó d1 √ó d2) / (d1 + d2))`
   - Where Œª = wavelength, d1 = distance to point, d2 = distance from point
   - Calculates clearance zone needed for optimal RF propagation
   - 60% clearance recommended for reliable communications

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)

## Known Limitations

- Elevation data accuracy depends on Open-Elevation API resolution (~30m in most areas)
- Weather conditions (temperature inversions, ducting) not modeled
- Path assumes great circle route (not actual terrain-following RF propagation)
- Knife-edge diffraction not calculated (shows only direct obstruction)
- Limited to VHF/UHF amateur bands (2m and 70cm currently supported)
